# pretty-simple-vanillajs-revolt-bot
A pretty simple revolt bot that replies to every message that says "snickersbar" and works in a browser
Proof of concept, pretty simple.

How to get it to work:

1. Change the thetoken variable in the code to be your bot token
2. Ok :verygood:

It will not only reply, but also log every message that says "snickersbar" along with a link to it, but it doesn't say what server it is from, because it is supposed to be simple and finding that out would probably make it less simple. Also it will show the ids of people who sent a message and not their username/nickname but again, that would make it less simple.

I hope this code helps you learn something somehow, as I did learn how to make this while making it.

Also, maybe don't use it in a big server or any public server in that matter.
As this bot does not have a limit of how many messages to send at the time, if someone spammed the word "snickersbar", you could get ratelimited or absolute worst case maybe even banned (though idk what wild server you would need to be in). And there could be even more issues with it that I'm not aware of, idk, this isn't really something I've done before. In any case, I don't take any responsibility, I just made this for fun.
